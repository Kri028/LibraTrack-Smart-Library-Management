## 🎯 Objectives of the Library Management System

### 📚 1. Efficient Book Management  
- Store and manage book details, including ISBN, title, category, rental price, author, and publisher.  
- Track book availability and rental pricing.  

### 🏷 2. Seamless Member Management  
- Maintain accurate records of library members.  
- Update member details such as address and registration date.  
- Identify members who have issued multiple books.  

### 🔄 3. Book Issuance & Return Tracking  
- Maintain a record of books issued and returned.  
- Retrieve books not yet returned using SQL joins.  
- Track books issued by specific employees.  

### 🏢 4. Branch & Employee Management  
- Store details of library branches and employees.  
- List employees along with their respective branch managers.  
- Identify employees who have issued multiple books.  

### 📊 5. Data Analytics & Reporting  
- Generate **summary tables** to track book issuance counts.  
- Compute **total rental income** by book category.  
- Create tables for books with rental prices above a certain threshold.  
- Retrieve books by category for easy access.  


### ⚡ 6. Database Operations & Query Optimization  
- Implement SQL queries for **data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion**.  
- Use **JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and DATE functions** for efficient query execution.  
- Create **custom tables using CTAS (Create Table As Select)** for optimized reporting.
